### üìù Summary
Rising prices on food and other necessities due to inflation have left underrepresented low-income people of color unable to buy food for their families. Supply chains for food distribution faced disruptions due to COVID-19 and increased consumer demand for food drastically. This raised food prices across the globe ‚Äì increasing the severity of food insecurity among the already 811 million people struggling to make ends meet ( [USGLC,](https://www.usglc.org/coronavirus/global-hunger/#:~:text=Supply%20chain%20disruptions%20due%20to,to%20bed%20hungry%20every%20night) ‚ÄúCovid-19 Brief: Impact on Food Security.‚Äù).

Historically places of worship have been pillars of food and hygiene distribution programs in New York City. Places of worship have relied on food donations from food manufacturers, businesses, and individuals to supplement their food inventory. It is unfortunate that these forms of distribution lack a platform for collaborating with each other on the distribution of food.

However, the current processes of food donation to food distribution centers, like places of worship, are not centered or streamlined and fail to bring all parties and stakeholders together to tackle food insecurity in NYC's underserved communities.
